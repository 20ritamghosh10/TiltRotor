# TiltRotor
Flight Controller code for a tilt rotor aircraft with VTOL capabilities
The code is under development and should not be used in real time flight. The code has been created from the arducopter, arduplane source codes and developed and modified as per needs. The authors/contributors should not be held responsible for any kind of damage caused for using this code in real time flights. Special thanks to the arducopter community.
